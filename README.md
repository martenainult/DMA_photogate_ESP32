# ADC DMA Example For Reading Photogate Value


This example in an implementation of ESP-IDF [ADC continuous read example](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/d29e53dc0c59d1b1b01c5e2c3ca1b22113828587/examples/peripherals/adc/continuous_read/main/continuous_read_main.c) which shows how to use ADC Continuous Read Mode (DMA Mode) to read from GPIO pins via on-chip ADC module(s). 

## How to use example

For initialization and extra information please look into the original example provided by espressif. The explanation is done with comments in the code.
